Duck Calculator 3.1.0

For your attention the very new Duck calculator 3.1.0 version is presented.
(All similarities to the Ubuntu Calculator could not be taken into consideration)
1. The current calculator can:
    a) do all the basic manipulations (+-*/)
    b) also solve equation with advanced signs (âˆš, ^, and brackets)
                        (if you see the word "brackets" which is not written correctly -
                        JUST FORGET, THAT YOU HAVE SEEN IT. P.S. I was writing code early in the morning)
    c) such errors as division by ZERO, character input, input not even number of brackets
        are evaluated in order to the errors, which are used in Python
            (!you would see a error message)
    d) all the equation stages I have written to logs, please follow the file to see
        basic equation errors or see the console output for INFO about stages themselves.
2. This calculator is supposed to be extended to "Advanced Mode" (4.0.0 Version) and
    "Programming Mode" (5.0.0 version) in the NEAREST FUTURE (!maybe)
3. Please, I will really appreciate it so much if someone would try to break it.

I like this task and working on it was just perfectly splendid! :) Thanks!
